#Challenges!!!!

#1 can you create a function that doubles the size of the image? (print every character twice, and every line twice?)

#2 Can you create a function that creates a compressed file using RLE?

#3 Can you create a function that reads your compressed file, so that print_bitmap() can be successfully called on it?
